# Aghbari Commerce — Development Progress Ledger

Use one entry per execution run. Keep implementation, verification, proof and deployment separate. Do not overwrite historical entries.

## Run 2026-10-10 — Integrated AI module and durable instructions

- **Repository:** Report-Engainall/aghbari-store
- **Base SHA last checked:** `a5f3924d30423f327b4c12fde8341daa446d682a`
- **Branch / PR:** `feat/integrated-ai-assistant` / [PR #4](https://github.com/Report-Engainall/aghbari-store/pull/4)
- **Implemented:** integrated Arabic RTL assistant route and menu; organization-scoped reads for existing AI reports/alerts/tasks; context reset across organizations; stale-request protection; truthful no-LLM disclosure; error/loading/retry handling for AI list screens; truthful dashboard metrics; new static contract assertions; canonical requirements and session-memory documents.
- **Repository evidence:** source files fetched/read back from GitHub in this run. PR comparison and changed filenames were inspected. Record the current live PR SHA at the next invocation.
- **Verified:** file existence and source assertions were inspected. Not a local build or browser proof.
- **Proven:** no runtime/production capability is classified as proven in this run.
- **Blocked / pending:** GitHub Actions latest Build and SQL Migration Chain conclusion for the final current head; browser E2E; live hosted-Supabase RLS; generative model backend and governance; backups/restore; full acceptance suite.
- **Deployment:** HOLD; not deployed; not merged to main.
- **Next action:** fetch latest PR head and Action conclusions, then audit pricing rule-target and deletion fallback against SQL logic; write exact tests before any safe merge.

## Status vocabulary
- **PROVEN:** runtime/end-to-end result observed and tied to the exact SHA with evidence.
- **VERIFIED:** source/config/assertion inspected or test has actually passed, but runtime proof may remain open.
- **PARTIAL:** some implementation exists, with explicit missing parts.
- **NOT_PROVEN:** evidence insufficient or test not run/result unknown.
- **BLOCKED:** exact prerequisite unavailable; name it.
- **HOLD:** do not merge/deploy/apply to production yet.
